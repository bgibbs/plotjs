I wrote originally threw this plotting object (plot.js) together a few years ago
as a quick X/Y point plot.  A short while later, I needed a totally different
type of plot.  I found that I only needed to change a couple of lines of code in
order to get this.

This is not production level code but only a simple demonstration of how one JS
functional object can be reused for differing purposes.

Mouse wheel zooms in/out.
Mouse left button to pan.
Scales try to do the right thing for all zoom levels.
